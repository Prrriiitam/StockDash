For this internship assignment I built a full-stack Stock Market Dashboard using React for the frontend and FastAPI (Python) for the backend. The UI includes a left scrollable list of 10+ companies and a main panel that displays interactive historical price charts powered by Chart.js. The backend serves REST endpoints to list companies, fetch historical price data (cached CSVs via yfinance), and compute a simple AI-based next-day closing price prediction.

For the AI component I implemented a lightweight machine-learning pipeline using lag-based features (previous day closes and rolling averages) and a RandomForestRegressor from scikit-learn. The model trains quickly on one-year historical data and outputs a predicted close price along with a simple model score. I chose Random Forest because it offers a robust baseline without heavy dependencies â€” ideal for a short, demonstrable internship project.

Key technologies: React, Chart.js, FastAPI, yfinance, SQLite (for caching), scikit-learn, Docker (optional). Challenges I encountered included ensuring reliable data fetching from external APIs and creating reproducible model training; I solved this by adding a local CSV cache and model serialization (joblib). Future enhancements could add technical indicators (RSI, MACD), more advanced time-series models (LSTM), and continuous deployment to Render/Railway. The repository contains full source, sample dataset, and screenshots.
